# DIRPS

DIRPS is the RPG-focused DODGE implementation experiment in TheFountain.

Its first rules stress test uses **GURPS Lite (Third Edition-era, June 2003)**, but GURPS is the external rules source, not the implementation identity. The purpose of DIRPS is to find RPG-shaped gaps in DODGE, exercise candidate neutral solutions through a deliberately bounded scenario, and feed reusable contracts upstream.

The directory intentionally mirrors the Wretched Demesne authored-source layout so contributors can move between the two projects without learning a second repository vocabulary.

## Maturity

DIRPS Scenario 01 remains **G6 — Targeted** and is now advancing through gameplay roadmap **Phase C — Frightened Witness social encounter**.

The authored DODGE document remains schema/core-valid and retains `dirps@0.1.0` at both `source` and `resolved-game`. `tools/resolve_dirps_dodge.py` produces `dirps-resolved-game.v1` and preserves standard DODGE runtime-state snapshots; `tools/dirps_runtime.py` preserves the accepted skill/investigation contracts and adds an authoritative reaction-roll + lookup-table social path; and `tools/dirps_debug_target.py` dispatches both accepted encounter kinds through runtime-owned semantics. `docs/phase-c-frightened-witness-validation.md` records the current gameplay evidence. Phase D and later scenario mechanics remain unimplemented; G7 is not claimed.

The generic TheFountain conformance runner must retain the DIRPS DODGE schema/source/resolver/resolved PASS lines. Discovered Python tests retain the named G5/G6/Phase A/Phase B evidence and add named Phase C social/runtime-target PASS lines.

## Authority boundary

The intended working order is:

```text
external rules reference
        ↓
DIRPS source/scenario facts
        ↓
DODGE 0.2.1 document
        +
DIRPS proto sidecar
        ↓
semantic validation / resolver
        ↓
resolved game
        ↓
runtime / replay / targets
```

The DODGE document targets DODGE 0.2.1 and remains resolved through the accepted G4 boundary. G5 adds a renderer-independent execution layer that consumes only `dirps-resolved-game.v1`; G6 adds a debug CLI that consumes the runtime rather than rereading or reinterpreting authored source. Its actor values explicitly declare actor ownership and Scenario 01 persistence; persistence beyond this bounded scenario remains intentionally unresolved for a later semantic gate. Anything that does not fit cleanly is declared in the DIRPS proto sidecar rather than smuggled into a renderer or runtime special case.

The proto sidecar records execution evidence without speculative promotion. `dice_resolution`, `procedure_context`, `actor_character_model`, `skill_model`, `resolution_trace`, and now `lookup_tables` are `exercised` / `not-yet-candidate`. Phase C uses the reaction table as the first concrete range-lookup need. `reaction_timing` remains `suspected` because an NPC reaction roll is not an interrupt window; `replay_session_history`, `visibility_and_secret_state`, `derived_values`, and `expressions` also remain `suspected`.

## Scenario 01

**The Missing Courier** is deliberately small. It is intended to exercise ordinary success rolls, a social interaction, an environmental challenge, one bounded combat exchange, state changes, rule-source traceability, and deterministic replay.

Scenario fiction and character values are DIRPS prototype assumptions. GURPS mechanics remain external authoritative rules and are not reproduced verbatim here.
